								<p>I was very generously given the opportunity to mentor a group from the Governor's School of Engineering and Technology in the
								summer of 2019. This definitely is their project, through and through; I was very impressed with their ability to work together as
								a team and their drive towards improving the project. They are definitely really talented and I think they are way further along
								than I was in high school.</p>

									<p><i>Good job guys! You all look so professional</i></p>

								<p>In the end, all I was really able to do for them was to give them design advice and 3D print stuff for them. It made me realize
								that I still have much to improve on and I want to do more projects of my own now.</p>
