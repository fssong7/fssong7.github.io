								<h1>Origin</h1>
								<p>Several times over the course of my college career, I've been frustrated with myself for not being organized and forgetting dates of
								important events. To solve this I wanted to create a calendar where I would be able to keep track of these things, while also having a list
								of things to do.</p>

								<h1>CAD</h1>
								<p>To make an organizational calendar, I wanted to use a white board so that I could easily write and erase items and account for the
								change of months and dates. In order to get all the sections at the spacing that I wanted, I designed the model in Autodesk Fusion 360.
								I was then able to laser cut the model onto the white board to these specifications.</p>

								<p>I think it turned out pretty good! The calendar is organized into different sections, that are good for keeping things organized.
								There is a: to-do section, classes section, general notes section, area where I can put post its, and a chart where I can keep track
								of my daily routine. The large part on the right is the calendar, where I can keep track of things that are going on throughout the
								month. I've been using this for the last few months and so far its been quite helpful. I think the next step is to build a marker
								stand that can hold all the expo markers and eraser.</p>
