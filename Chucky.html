								<h1>What is this thing?</h1>
								<p>Chucky is a self designed and built table tennis serving robot. It can hold up to 50 table tennis balls at a time
								and serve them one by one with 4 different types of spin: top spin, back spin, side spin, and no spin. </p>
								<p>The goal of this project was to make a table tennis robot that is easily transportable(it can fit in a backpack),
								is affordable, and can be built easily so others can replicate and build one on their own.</p>

								<p>In order to recieve funding for this project, I wrote up a business proposal that detailed what the project entailed of,
								the process that I took towards designing it, and a rough budget of how much it would cost. I then sent it to various sources
								at my university, and was rejected quickly. Although I wasn't able to recieve funding, I still found the proposal helpful
								towards improving my writing skills and forcing me to design and plan much of the project out before actually building it.</p>

								<p>Additionally, I was given the opportunity to present at Rutgers Day, a university wide event that is open to the public.
								Thousands of people in the New Jersey Area travel to Rutgers to look at different projects going on at the university.
								I was lucky enough to be able to present and test my model. Below is a picture of me demonstrating it and letting people try it
							  out! I had a ton of fun and was really suprised by the sheer number of people that enjoyed trying it out. From this demo I
							  learned about a ton of improvements that I should make, of few of them being: durability, a better power source, cleaner
								electronics, more streamline design, etc.</p>

								<p>The final iteration of the table tennis robot was similarly designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and laser cut out of 1/8" plywood.
								It's name, Chucky, describes it's nature of chucking balls. Additionally, the electronics were enclosed in a box on the back of the
							  feeder's frame. This also allowed for various switches and potentiometers to be added, that allowed for manual control of each of the
								motors, feeder rate, and power. Chucky now runs on a 12V power supply instead of rechargable batteries, in order to ensure that one
								can play for longer periods of time without worrying about motors slowing down.</p>
								<p>I plan to eventually come back to this project, probably some time this year; I plan to redesign the main frame to make it more
								space efficient, allow for control through a phone app, and choose parts that will make Chucky even cheaper and more affordable.</p>
