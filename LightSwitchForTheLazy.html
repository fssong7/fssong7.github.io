								<h1>Resolving Roomate Issues</h1>
								<p>During my freshman year of college, I got along quite well with my roommate. However, if there was one thing we would fight over,
								it was who would have to get out of bed at night and turn the light switch off before we went to sleep. We had intense bouts of
								rock-paper-scissors and some insane bets that required way more effort than getting up and turning off the light switch, but it became
								a matter of pride to not turn off the light.</p>

								<p>In the end, I caved and decided to build a system that would allow each of us to turn off the light from our beds, so we wouldn't
								fight over who had to get up.</p>

								<h1>CAD</h1>
								<p>My plan for turning off the light switch was to use a yardstick as a pivot. The yardstick would be placed near the bed. Turning it
								one way would turn the light on, turning it the other way would turn it off. It was able to do this because it utilized a dual string
								system, with one string on each end of the yardstick, that loosed one end when the other end got tightened.</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<div class="row aln-center">
							<div class="col-4">
								<p>To use this dual string system, I had to overcome several obstacles, height changes, and a wall orietation change. To accomplish
								this, I designed a pulley in CAD such that it could fit both strings and be mounted in any orientation. It was then 3D printed at
								our university's Makerspace and secured to the wall using command strips.</p>
